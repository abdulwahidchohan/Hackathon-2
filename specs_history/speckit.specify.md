# Specify — Phase I Task CRUD (Evolution of Todo)

**Source:** specs/features/task-crud.md, specs/constitution.md

## Requirements

1. **Add Task** — User can create a task with required title (1–200 chars) and optional description (max 1000 chars). Store in memory; assign unique ID; confirm to user.
2. **View Task List** — User can list all tasks with ID, title, description, completed status. Empty list shows a clear message.
3. **Update Task** — User can update a task by ID; provide title and/or description; validation same as add. Error if ID not found.
4. **Delete Task** — User can delete a task by ID. Error if ID not found.
5. **Mark as Complete** — User can toggle completion by ID. Error if ID not found.

## Acceptance criteria (summary)

- Title: required, 1–200 chars. Description: optional, max 1000 chars.
- IDs: unique per session, generated by store (e.g. incremental).
- Storage: in-memory only; no persistence.
- Errors: "Task not found" (or equivalent) for invalid ID on update/delete/complete.

## Domain rules

- Single store per process. No auth, no multi-user in Phase I.
